## features
- Adds a cartoony and expressive mouth to you and your friends avatars.
- Reacts to player state. (low health = sad mouth, high health = happy mouth) Wow!
- Animates when a player types in chat. (Lip sync is to the best of my ability)
- Animates when players are using voice chat with [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat).
- its objectively funny
